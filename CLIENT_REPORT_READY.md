## Client Questions to Anticipate

**Q: Why isn't everything 100% complete?**
A: 85% is complete and operational. The remaining 15% (workflow execution engine and channel integrations) requires 4-6 weeks of additional development. Core features are ready for immediate use.

**Q: Can we use the platform now?**
A: Yes. CRM, lead qualification, campaign planning, and analytics are fully operational. Automated campaign execution will be available after Phase 3.

**Q: What about the failed $100K+ outbound campaigns?**
A: The tools to replace those campaigns are built (workflow builder, lead qualification, analytics). Phase 3 adds the automation to execute campaigns at scale.

**Q: When will Phase 3 be complete?**
A: Estimated 4-6 weeks from approval. Critical path items are workflow execution engine (2-3 weeks) and email integration (1-2 weeks).
