        OPTICWISE - GOOGLE SUITE INTEGRATION SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

Hello!

To connect OpticWise with your Google Suite (Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, 
and Google Calendar), we need you to create a Google Cloud Project and provide 
us with the OAuth credentials. This is a one-time setup that takes about 10-15 
minutes.

Follow these step-by-step instructions:

================================================================================
STEP 1: ACCESS GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE
================================================================================

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. Sign in with your Google Workspace admin account (the account that manages 
   your organization's Google Suite)

3. If this is your first time, you may need to accept the Terms of Service


================================================================================
STEP 2: CREATE A NEW PROJECT
================================================================================

1. Click the project dropdown at the top of the page (next to "Google Cloud")

2. Click "NEW PROJECT" in the top right of the popup

3. Enter the following:
   - Project name: "OpticWise Integration"
   - Organization: Select your organization
   - Location: Select your organization folder

4. Click "CREATE"

5. Wait for the project to be created (you'll see a notification)

   dropdown

   next one.

STEP 4: CONFIGURE THE OAUTH CONSENT SCREEN
================================================================================

STEP 5: CREATE OAUTH CREDENTIALS
================================================================================

   https://opticwise-backend.onrender.com

7. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", click "ADD URI" and enter EACH of these 
   (click ADD URI for each one):

   https://opticwise-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/callback/google
   https://opticwise-backend.onrender.com/api/integrations/google/callback

8. Click "CREATE"

9. A popup will appear with your credentials. 
   
   ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Copy and save these values securely! ⚠️
   
   - Client ID: (looks like: xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com)
   - Client Secret: (looks like: GOCSPX-xxxxxxxxx)

10. Click "OK"


================================================================================
STEP 6: (OPTIONAL) CREATE A SERVICE ACCOUNT FOR BACKGROUND OPERATIONS
================================================================================

If you want OpticWise to perform background operations (like scheduled syncs), 
you'll also need a service account:

1. Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" at the top

2. Select "Service account"

3. Enter:
   - Service account name: "OpticWise Service"
   - Service account ID: (auto-generated)
   - Description: "Service account for OpticWise background operations"

4. Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE"

5. For "Grant this service account access to project":
   - Role: Select "Basic" > "Editor"

6. Click "CONTINUE", then "DONE"

7. Click on the newly created service account email

8. Go to the "KEYS" tab

9. Click "ADD KEY" > "Create new key"

10. Select "JSON" and click "CREATE"

11. A JSON file will be downloaded - keep this file secure!


================================================================================
STEP 7: SEND US THE CREDENTIALS
================================================================================

Please send us the following information securely:

□ OAuth Client ID
□ OAuth Client Secret  
□ Service Account JSON file (if created)
□ The Google Workspace admin email that created these credentials

⚠️  SECURITY NOTE: These credentials are sensitive. Please send them via:
   - Encrypted email, OR
   - A secure password-protected document, OR
   - A secure sharing platform (like a password manager's sharing feature)

DO NOT send credentials via regular unencrypted email or messaging apps.


================================================================================
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
================================================================================

Once we receive your credentials, we will:

1. Configure OpticWise to connect with your Google Suite
2. Test the integration to ensure everything works correctly
3. Notify you when the integration is ready
4. Provide instructions for your team to authorize their individual accounts


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Common Issues:

Q: I don't see "Internal" option on OAuth consent screen
A: This option is only available for Google Workspace accounts. If you're 
   using a personal Gmail, select "External".

Q: I can't find an API in the library
A: Make sure you're searching with the exact name (e.g., "Gmail API" not 
   "Gmail"). Also ensure the correct project is selected.

Q: I get an error when adding redirect URIs
A: Make sure the URIs are exactly as shown above, with https:// and no 
   trailing slashes.
