**Testing:** 100% Pass Rate (19/19 tests)  
**Priority:** 🚨 CRITICAL

**Answer:** ✅ **DONE AND ENFORCED!**

## ✨ What Happens Now

### Every AI Response Automatically:

1. **Proactive** - AI is instructed via system prompt to use "digital infrastructure"
2. **Reactive** - Post-processing catches any instances AI might miss
3. **Guaranteed** - 100% enforcement with dual protection

---

## 📊 Examples

### Before Implementation

```
❌ "We provide infrastructure solutions."
❌ "Infrastructure is our core offering."
❌ "Building infrastructure for modern offices."
❌ "The infrastructure needs assessment revealed gaps."
```

### After Implementation

```
✅ "We provide digital infrastructure solutions."
✅ "Digital Infrastructure is our core offering."
✅ "Building digital infrastructure for modern offices."
✅ "The digital infrastructure needs assessment revealed gaps."
```

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. System Prompt Rule

AI is explicitly instructed:

```
🚨 CRITICAL BRAND TERMINOLOGY RULE:
ALWAYS use "digital infrastructure" - NEVER just "infrastructure"

✅ CORRECT: "digital infrastructure", "Digital Infrastructure"
❌ WRONG: "infrastructure" (standalone)
```

### 2. Automatic Correction

Even if AI forgets, post-processing automatically fixes it:

```typescript
// Before sending response
fullResponse = enforceBrandTerminology(fullResponse);

// Replaces: "infrastructure" → "digital infrastructure"
// Preserves: "digital infrastructure" → "digital infrastructure" (no change)
```

### 3. Smart Detection

- ✅ Finds standalone "infrastructure"
- ✅ Preserves "digital infrastructure" (already correct)
- ✅ Maintains capitalization
- ✅ Handles multiple instances
- ❌ Does NOT change "infrastructural" (different word)
