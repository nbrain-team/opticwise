Chris,
Thanks, Im taking a look now.
Wow, there's so much here.
Also, quite fascinating to see a gov't website and program differs so
greatly from commercial.

**Subject:** OpticWise x TIWA | Strategic Sponsorship Proposal for February Event
**From:** Bill Douglas <bill.douglas@opticwise.com>
**To:** charley@inbuildingwirelessassociation.com, richb@fifthgenmedia.com
**Date:** 1/15/2026
**Length:** 1493 characters

**Body:**

```
Rich and Charley,

Thanks again for the great conversation today. As discussed, I’m excited
about the opportunity to support TIWA’s February 10 event in Fort
Lauderdale—not just as a sponsor, but as a strategic contributor aligned
with the audience and mission.

Attached is a simple proposal outlining what OpticWise will contribute, and
what we’re asking for in return to ensure visibility, value for attendees,
and shared success for the event.

We believe this is a natural fit. TIWA’s focus on in-building wireless and
AI readiness pairs perfectly with our message: *You can’t do AI until you
own & control your data and digital infrastructures.*

Let me know if this version works for you or if there are any small tweaks
we should make. I’d like to confirm final details and shipping for the 150
books asap.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts—and to being there in person.

Best,
Bill

Thank you for staying on top of this. Yes, we’re aware.

I’m still working on setting up a few intro calls with leads generated from
the campaign. Bill will be traveling over the next couple of weeks, so most
likely I’ll follow up in February.

Thanks again,
Roxana

Hi Jim,

Absolutely no problem at all to reschedule, and I hope everything goes well.

Based on your Calendly availability, I’ve rescheduled the recording for
this Friday at *10:30 AM MT*. Bill will be traveling over the next couple
of weeks, so if this time doesn’t work on your end, we’ll need to look at
rescheduling for sometime in February.

Please let me know if this works for you.

Thanks,
Roxana

Danny just wanted to send you a quick note before our meeting next week.

How's the rest of the system going outside of what you showed me two weeks
ago?
I know it's been a long time in between meetings. I see the scope of work,
and I just don't know where all the other stuff is.., like:
*Module 1: AI Brain Infrastructure*

*Module 2: Marketing Automation Platform*

*Module 3: Intelligent AI Chat (Internal & External)*


Maybe I'm missing something, but I see the CRM online and the ingestion of
emails and OW docs into OWNet.

I know there was the holiday, so I can assume some setbacks, but we
executed on Nov 7 and the goal was 12 weeks.
Let's clarify status, schedule, and next steps when we talk next week.
I want to make sure you have everything you need from us, too.

There are several new things I might wanna add once we get done with the
initial project.

Loving this OWNet concept.
Let's keep the momentum going!

**Subject:** Happy New Year + one ask on OpticWise
**From:** Bill Douglas <bill.douglas@opticwise.com>
**To:** Bill Weiss <wcweiss@promar.com>
**Date:** 1/9/2026
**Length:** 1822 characters

**Body:**

```
Bill —

Happy New Year! Atlanta was a blast — genuinely a lot of fun (3 nights of
shows with friends; see pics below) — and after that I went to visit Mom,
which was a good reset.

How was your New Year with the family? How're Tammi and Parker?

Real talk: I’ve been honest with you before about fatigue, and it’s still
real. My head is clear and I’m executing well, but the “build a monster
company for years” drive isn’t where it used to be.

The tension is: the market is huge, and what we’ve carved out feels
uniquely valuable. I don’t want to quit — I want the smartest outcome.

I’m staring at three moves:

   1.

   commit to *OW 3.0* and build the company, meaning funding, etc,
   2.

   *run the pilot* and let the market validate the wedge, the intention
   being JV/merge/lift OW,
   3.

   *move OpticWise along* while the story is strong, running it as a
   lifestyle biz.

In your opinion, what’s the best next step *given who I am right now*?

If you’ve got 15 minutes next week, I’d value your straight answer.

— Bill

Hello!

I work for INDUSTRY SLC; last week, we had a Property Management company transition. Meaning, all of our emails, and more, have changed, and we are now working for a different company. I was able to log into our INDUSTRY Corp Wi-Fi here at the building using my previous email from our previous employer (Cushman & Wakefield), but not into the OW Portal.

I reached out to support over the phone, and they suggested sending an email.

How can we start the process of giving our new emails registered and access to the portal? Was there an admin listed previously for our Cushman & Wakefield/INDUSTRY SLC account?

Thank you,

Hi Andy,

The setup for OMI 5S Guest hasn’t changed. As always, the password changes automatically weekly (at 3am CT each Monday). That mechanism will stop now that OpticWise is stepping out at the end of the day Dec 31, and the current password will freeze.

We’ll have all proprietary elements removed from all configs, and will send over admin credentials as well.

Thank you,
